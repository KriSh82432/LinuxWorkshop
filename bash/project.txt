If you're given a chance to lead a project, here are 2 must-have smart qualities!
Both these qualities go hand in hand. Having just one of these feels handicapped.
Smart Responsibility - you take up initiatives and become accountable towards a goal.
No matter you do all the work or delegate the tasks, when you're responsible, you ensure you complete the goal.
But, wait! What makes being responsible smart?
Smart responsibility comes by delegation! You delegate the works to the right people and ensure the goal is attained.
Proactiveness - to ensure the tasks are moving forward, and not stuck due to any dependency.
When you delegate a task, you need to remind, follow up and collect all the delegated works. That's where proactiveness comes in to picture.
